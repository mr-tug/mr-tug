                                Tray 1 is not operable, so make sure to read and follow the

                        You cannot wirelessly print from your phone/tablet to a lab printer.  Ways 
                        to print your document from your mobile device include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Email it to yourself, then use a lab computer to print the file.  
                                This is usually the quickest approach.  Make sure to bring your
                                phone to the lab in case your online account requires getting a
                                text or otherwise using your phone to log in.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Save your document to a USB drive or connect your phone or tablet 
                                to a lab computer with a USB dongle (connector), then print the 
                                file same as any other USB drive.
                             </li>
                         </ul>
                         <ul>
                             <li>
                                Connect your mobile device to a lab Ethernet cable using an RJ-45
                                adapter (USB-C for newer Android and Lightening for iOS) then
                                print.  The lab does not currently have adapters, but they're
                                available online or from computer retailers.  Your device's 
                                printing service might need configuring and the printers list 
                                updated.  See a lab monitor for details.

                    There are ethernet cables in both labs, and these provide faster and 
                    presumably safer internet access.  If your computer does not have an RJ45
                    (oversized phone jack) port, you should be able to buy USB adapters wherever 
                    computer accessories are sold.

                <div class='topic-text'>
                    You can print to all the lab printers when connected via ethernet, but you
                    might need to first add them to your settings.
